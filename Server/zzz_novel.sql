(1, 'Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland', 'CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\r\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\r\nit, ''and what is the use of a book,'' thought Alice ''without pictures or\r\nconversation?''\r\n\r\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\r\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\nclose by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\r\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ''Oh dear!\r\nOh dear! I shall be late!'' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\r\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\r\nit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\r\nOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\r\nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\r\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\r\nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\r\nafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\r\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.', 'Lewis Carroll'),
(2, 'The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana', '\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number\r\nof works treating especially of love. Everywhere the subject is dealt\r\nwith differently, and from various points of view. In the present\r\npublication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is\r\nconsidered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which\r\nis called the ''Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,'' or Aphorisms on Love, by\r\nVatsyayana.\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date\r\nof the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters\r\nfollowing the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.\r\nIt is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of\r\nthe same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after\r\nVatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great\r\nauthority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nBesides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same\r\nsubject are procurable in India:--\r\n\r\n     1. The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love.\r\n\r\n     2. The Panchasakya, or the five arrows.\r\n\r\n     3. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love.\r\n\r\n     4. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love.\r\n\r\n     5. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love.\r\n\r\n     6. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called\r\n          Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.\r\n\r\nThe author of the ''Secrets of Love'' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He\r\ncomposed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When\r\nwriting his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself "Siddha\r\npatiya pandita," _i.e._, an ingenious man among learned men. The work\r\nwas translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author''s name was\r\nwritten as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations\r\ninto other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the\r\nsubject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which\r\nis identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words\r\nKoka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nThe work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten\r\nchapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in\r\nthis work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four\r\nclasses of women, viz., the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as\r\nalso the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the\r\ndifferent classes become subject to love. The author adds that he wrote\r\nthese things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of\r\nwhom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It\r\nis difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the\r\nwork was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after\r\nthat of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that\r\nare still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the\r\nsubject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are\r\nextant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that\r\nKukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have\r\nmentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the\r\nothers.', 'Vatsyayana'),
(3, 'For the School Colours', '"It"s the limit!" exploded Laura.\r\n\r\n"An atrocious shame!" agreed Janet.\r\n\r\n"Gives me nerve shock!" mourned Ethelberga gloomily.\r\n\r\n"You see," continued Laura, popping the tray of her box on to the floor and sitting down on her bed, so as the better to address her audience—"you see, it"s been plumped upon us without any warning. Miss Thompson must have arranged it long ago, but she never let out so much as a teeny-weeny hint. If I"d known before I came back I"d have asked Father to give a term"s notice and let me leave at Christmas. Crystal clear, I would."\r\n\r\n"Rather! so would this child."\r\n\r\n"I guess we all should."\r\n\r\n"I call it so mean to have sprung it on us like this! I really couldn"t have believed it of Miss Thompson. She"s gone down miles in my estimation. I can never feel the same towards her again—never! Those Hawthorners! Oh, to think of it!"\r\n\r\n"What"s the matter?" asked a fourth voice, as another girl, still in hat and coat, and carrying her travelling-bag, entered the dormitory.', 'Angela Brazil'),
(4, 'The Odyssey of Homer', 'Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire.\r\n\r\nAnd this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis or his history, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an introduction of extended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded; and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective probability of its details.', 'Homer, translated by Alexander Pope'),
(5, 'A Study In Scarlet', 'IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy"s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.\r\n\r\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.', 'Arthur Conan Doyle'),
(6, 'Emma', 'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\r\n\r\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister"s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\r\n\r\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse"s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor"s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.', 'Jane Austen'),
(7, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz', 'Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer"s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.', 'L. Frank Baum'),
(8, 'Little Women', 'Christmas won"t be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.\r\n\r\n"It"s so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.\r\n\r\n"I don"t think it"s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff.\r\n\r\n"We"ve got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth contentedly from her corner.\r\n\r\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, "We haven"t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn"t say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can"t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don"t," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.', 'Louisa May Alcott'),
(9, 'Candide', 'In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners. His countenance was a true picture of his soul. He combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of the family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron"s sister, by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would never marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one quarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through the injuries of time.\r\n\r\nThe Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung with tapestry. All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at need; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was his grand almoner. They called him "My Lord," and laughed at all his stories.\r\n\r\nThe Baron"s lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was therefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her daughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron"s son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss was the oracle of the family, and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.', 'Voltaire'),
(10, 'Outa Karel"s Stories', 'It was winter in the Great Karroo. The evening air was so crisp and cutting that one seemed to hear the crick-crack of the frost, as it formed on the scant vegetation. A skraal windje blew from the distant mountains, bringing with it a mingled odour of karroo-bush, sheep-kraals, and smoke from the Kafir huts—none, perhaps, desirable in itself, but all so blent and purified in that rare, clear atmosphere, and so subservient to the exhilarating freshness, that Pietie van der Merwe took several sniffs of pleasure as he peered into the pale moonlight over the lower half of the divided door. Then, with a little involuntary shiver, he closed the upper portion and turned to the ruddy warmth of the purring fire, which Willem was feeding with mealie-cobs from the basket beside him.\r\n\r\nLittle Jan sat in the corner of the wide, old-fashioned rustbank, his large grey eyes gazing wistfully into the red heart of the fire, while his hand absently stroked Torry, the fox terrier, curled up beside him.\r\n\r\nMother, in her big Madeira chair at the side table, yawned a little over her book; for, winter or summer, the mistress of a karroo farm leads a busy life, and the end of the day finds her ready for a well-earned rest.', 'Sanni Metelerkamp'),
(11, 'Sense and Sensibility', 'The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman"s days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.', 'Jane Austen'),
(12, 'Persuasion', 'Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed. This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\r\n\r\n"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\r\n\r\n"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."\r\n\r\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer"s hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary"s birth--"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset," and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.', 'Jane Austen'),
(13, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.', 'Oscar Wilde'),
(14, 'Grimms" Fairy Tales', 'A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o"clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener"s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, "One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird."', 'The Brothers Grimm'),
(15, 'War and Peace', '"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don"t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my "faithful slave," as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news."\r\n\r\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\r\n\r\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer."', 'Leo Tolstoy'),
(16, 'Conservation Reader', 'The earth is our home. It is a great treasure house filled with the most wonderful things. Although people have lived on the earth for many thousands of years, they have been very slow in learning the secrets of their treasure house. This is because early men were much like the lower animals. During all these years their minds have been slowly growing. Now we can learn and understand many things which our ancestors of long ago could not.\r\n\r\nIn habits and appearance the first men that roamed the earth were little different from the other animals except that they walked upright. When they had enough to eat and a home safe from enemies, they seemed perfectly happy and contented.\r\n\r\nThese early men lived in the same wonderful treasure house as we do, but they did not know how to make use of its riches. In truth, their wants were so few that they would have had no use for the things that now seem so necessary to us. The rich fields about them lay untilled. The gold, silver, copper, and iron in the earth remained undiscovered; and the animals and birds that we now use in so many ways then served them mainly for food.\r\n\r\nSince they had no furry coats to keep them warm as do the animals of the cold regions, and had not learned to make clothing, their homes must have been in the warm parts of the earth. While they were without weapons to defend themselves against the lion and tiger, yet they were sharp witted and very quick in their movements and thus were usually able to escape their more powerful enemies.', 'Harold W. Fairbanks'),
(17, 'True and Other Stories', 'It might have been yesterday, but in simple fact it was three hundred years ago, that something happened which has an important bearing on this story of the present.\r\n\r\nAntiquity is a great discourager of the sympathies: the centuries are apt to weigh like lead on an individual human sentiment. Yet we find it pleasant sometimes to throw off their weight, and thereby to discover that it is a mere feather in the scale as against the beating of a heart.\r\n\r\nI know that when I speak of Guy Wharton as having been alive and in love in the year 1587, you will feel a certain patronizing pity for him—because he is not alive now. So do I. But then it is possible that you will be interested, notwithstanding—because he was a lover. Would you like to hear what experience he had? I promise not to go through the history of those three hundred years. The story of Guy is merely the starting-point of my narrative.\r\n\r\nHe was in love with a sweet English girl, Gertrude Wylde, who lived in Surrey; and she, for her part, was the daughter of a small tenant-farmer there, well connected as to family, but not well furnished with worldly goods, Guy"s father was a country gentleman; but that circumstance failed to affect the young man"s eyesight and emotions injuriously; he beheld Gertrude, and he loved her. I can see it all, now, as if it were something that had happened to myself—how they strolled together in those wondrous lanes hedged with hawthorn and brier and hazel, which stray so sweetly over the rolling lands about Dorking; how they met beneath the old yew tree where, half way up Box Hill, it hung out its foliage black as night, spotted with strange waxen blossoms of scarlet, like drops of blood upon a funeral-pall; how they wandered in the untamed forest of great box trees at the top; what joys they had, what anxieties beset them.', 'George Parsons Lathrop'),
(18, 'Book of Etiquette', 'At a meeting of army officers during the Civil War, one of them began to relate a questionable story, remarking, as if to excuse his lack of good taste, that "there were no ladies present." General Grant, who was acting as chairman of the meeting, remarked, "No, but there are gentlemen"—and he refused to allow the officer to continue the story.\r\n\r\nWhat is a gentleman? The question is an old one. It cannot be ancestry, for often the son of most noble and honored parentage is merely a coarse compound of clay and money, offered to society as a gentleman, It cannot be dress—for surely Beau Brummell was not what the world loves to call a gentleman, despite his stiffly starched cravats and brightly polished boots. It cannot be money, for then many a common thief, made wealthy by his ill-gotten gains, would be entitled to the name of gentleman.\r\n\r\nNo, it is something that goes deeper than ancestry or dress or wealth—something that is nobler and finer than any, or all, of these. Perhaps it can be best expressed by this beautiful example of what true etiquette can mean:\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher, on a very cold day, stopped to buy a newspaper from a ragged youngster who stood shivering on a corner. "Poor little fellow," he said, "aren"t you cold standing here?" The boy looked up with a smile and said, "I was, sir—before you passed."', 'Lillian Eichler'),
(19, 'The Siege of the Seven Suitors', 'I dined with Hartley Wiggins at the Hare and Tortoise on an evening in October, not very long ago. It may be well to explain that the Hare and Tortoise is the smallest and most select of clubs, whose windows afford a pleasant view of Gramercy Park. The club is comparatively young, and it is our joke that we are so far all tortoises, creeping through our several professions without aid from any hare. I hasten to explain that I am a chimney doctor. Wiggins is a lawyer; at least I have seen his name in a list of graduates of the Harvard Law School, and he has an office down-town where I have occasionally found him sedately playing solitaire while he waited for some one to take him out to luncheon. He spends his summers on a South Dakota ranch, from which he derives a considerable income. When tough steaks are served from the club grill, we always attribute them to the cattle on Wiggins"s hills. Or if the lamb is ancient, we declare it to be of Wiggins"s shepherding. It is the way of our humor to hold Wiggins responsible for things. His good nature is usually equal to the worst we can do to him. He is the kind of fellow that one instinctively indicts without hearing testimony. We all know perfectly well that Wiggins"s ranch is a wheat ranch.', 'Meredith Nicholson'),
(20, 'The Lure of the Camera', 'Two pictures, each about the size of a large postage-stamp, are among my treasured possessions. In the first, a curly-headed boy of two, in a white dress, is vigorously kicking a football. The second depicts a human wheelbarrow, the body composed of a sturdy lad of seven, whose two plump arms serve admirably the purpose of a wheel, his stout legs making an excellent pair of handles, while the motive power is supplied by an equally robust lad of eight, who grasps his younger brother firmly by the ankles.\r\n\r\nThese two photographs, taken with a camera so small that in operation it was completely concealed between the palms of my hands, revealed to me for the first time the fascination of amateur photography. The discovery meant that whatever interested me, even if no more than the antics of my children, might be instantly recorded. I had no idea of artistic composition, nor of the proper manipulation of plates, films, and printing papers. Still less did I foresee that the tiny little black box contained the germ of 4 an indefinable impulse, which, expanding and growing more powerful year by year, was to lead me into fields which I had never dreamed of exploring, into habits of observation never before a part of my nature, and into a knowledge of countless places of historic and literary interest as well as natural beauty and grandeur, which would never have been mine but for the lure of the camera.', 'Charles S.

(21, 'Loveliness', 'Loveliness sat on an eider-down cushion embroidered with cherry-colored puppies on a pearl satin cover. The puppies had gold eyes. They were drinking a saucer of green milk. Loveliness wore a new necktie, of cherry, a shade or two brighter than the puppies, and a pearl-gray, or one might call it a silver-gray jacket. He was sitting in the broad window sill, with his head tipped a little, thoughtfully, towards the left side, as the heads of nervous people are said to incline. He was dreamily watching the street, looking for any one of a few friends of his who might pass by, and for the letter-carrier, who was somewhat late.\r\n\r\nLoveliness had dark, brilliant eyes, remarkably alert, but reflective when in repose. Part of their charm lay in the fact that one must watch for their best expression; for Loveliness wore bangs. He had a small and delicate nose, not guiltless of an aristocratic tip, with a suspicion of a sniff at the inferior orders of society. In truth, Loveliness was an aristocrat to the end of his tongue, which curled daintily against his opalescent teeth. At this moment it lay between his teeth, and hung forward as if he held a roseleaf in his lips; and this was the final evidence of his birth and breeding.', 'Elizabeth Stuart Phelps'),
(22, 'Amy in Acadia', '"No, Fritz, I cannot—"\r\n\r\n"You will not."\r\n\r\n"Well, then I will not ask mother to invite you to go on with us."\r\n\r\nAmy spoke decidedly, but Fritz was not ready to give up.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Amy, do be reasonable! I cannot say anything more to your mother, for you are in an obstinate mood, evidently determined to persuade yourself that you do not wish us to travel with you."\r\n\r\n"That is true; I do not wish you to go on with us."\r\n\r\n"But you and I are such friends."\r\n\r\n"So we are, and so we shall continue to be. Because we are such friends, I am sure that you will forgive me for being so—"\r\n\r\n"So unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"No—reasonable. Now just look at the whole thing sensibly. Here we are—mamma and I and two girls."\r\n\r\n"What do you call yourself? Aren"t you a girl?"\r\n\r\n"Don"t interrupt; perhaps I should have said two schoolgirls. We have come away partly for rest and change, partly for study. So it would only upset all our plans to have you and your friend with us. You"d be dreadfully in the way."', 'Helen Leah Reed');
